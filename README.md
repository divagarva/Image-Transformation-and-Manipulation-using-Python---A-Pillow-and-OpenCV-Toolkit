# Image-Transformation-and-Manipulation-using-Python---A-Pillow-and-OpenCV-Toolkit
 This Python project demonstrates image transformations using both the Pillow and OpenCV libraries. It covers resizing, rotating, flipping, and adjusting brightness. The transformations are visualized in a comparison plot, showing how both libraries handle each operation, providing a side-by-side analysis.
